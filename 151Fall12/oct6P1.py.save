#we will write a function foreign_fee that 
#has two formal parameters
#purchase and percent
#this function will calculate and print the
#foreign transaction fee

#we will write a main function that will ask user to enter 
#price of item and then calculate and display 
#foreign transaction fee for each credit card

#we will declare three global constants to hold transaction fee
#for each credit card 

A=0.02
B=0.01
C=0.03

	Master_card= float(input("enter transaction foreign fee for Master card "))
	B_o_A= float(input("enter transaction foreign fee Bank of America card "))

	#Part II: function calls
