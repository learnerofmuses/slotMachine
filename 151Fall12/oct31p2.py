#Write a program that first reads one positive integer that will indicate 
#an amount of input integer number that will come after that. The program 
#will read the series of the integer numbers (amount of integer numbers 
#will be equal to the first input number) and will find the amount of the 
#even numbers that are divisible by 4, their sum and their average


#example:
#input: 5 4 6 9 12 8 
#explanation: first number 5 is the size of the input
#means that program will process 5 integers: 4 6 9 12 8 
#output: #there are 3 even numbers divisible by 4 
#their sum is: 24
#their average is: 8.0

#example:
#input: 4 6 7 8 10 
#explanation: first number 4 is only to tell how many inputs to process
#average is 8.0

#output:
#there are 1 even number divisible by 4
#their sum is 8 
#their average is 8
