#In this lab you will write and test the following functions

#1. def build_board_random(row, col) - this function fills the board with 
#random numbers 0 and 1. A live organism is represented by 1 and a dead 
#organism is represented by 0. The sizes of the board will be user 
#input and determine in main

#2. def build_board_user(row, col) this function fills the board with 
#user input: 0 and 1. A live organism is represented by 1 and a dead 
#organism is represented by 0.

#3. def printBoard(board, row, col) - prints the board (prints 2-d list 
#in matrix form) - we wrote this function already

#4. def copyBoard(board, row, col) - creates and returns the copy of the 
#board

#5. def change(oldBoard, newBoard, row, col) - returns 1 if both 2-d 
#lists, oldBoard and newBoard, are the same, and 0 otherwise

#6. def count(board, row, col) - counts and returns the number of live 
#organisms

#7.def neigh(board, row, col, i, j) - finds and returns the number of 
#live organisms around the cell position i, j

#8.def all_neigh(board, row, col) - this function creates a 2-d list, 
#with each element equals to the number of live organisms of 2-d list 
#scores. The function returns a new list.
