/* Write a function double divisorAverage (int n) that finds and returns 
the average of all divisors of the parameter n. You can assume that n is 
positive. Write a C program that reads 5 integers. For each input number 
the program performs the following: if the input is zero or negative, the 
program prints an error message, and if the input is positive, the program 
prints the average of all divisors of the input number. The program uses 
function divisorAverage to calculate the average of the divisors. Enter 
all inputs on one line and don't include user prompt printf statement in 
the loop.*/
