/*Write a function double randomAverage (int n) that finds and returns the 
average among n random numbers. Each random number is between 1 and 10. 
For the testing purposes, print all randomly generated numbers. Write a C 
program that reads one integer, n. If the input is zero or negative, the 
program prints an error message, and if the input is positive, the program 
prints the average of n random numbers using function randomAverage*/
