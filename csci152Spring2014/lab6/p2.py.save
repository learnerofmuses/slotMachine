#Write a function def remove_below(scores, threshold) that has two 
#parameters, list of scores and the score threshold. The function 
#removes all scores below the threshold from the list and creates a list 
#of all scores below the threshold. The function returns the number of 
#skaters who would not be able to compete and the list of their scores. 
#Write a program that asks user to enter the number of skaters and the 
#score for each skater - FLOAT NUMBER between 1.0 and 100.0 and uses 
#functon remove_below to find the number of the skaters who would be 
#able to continue, along with their scores, and the number of skaters 
#who would not be able to continue along with their scores.
