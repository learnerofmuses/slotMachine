#Design a program that asks the user to enter a series
#of 20 numbers. The program should store the numbers in a list 
#and then display the following data:

#the lowest number in the list
#the highest number in the list
#the total of the number in the list 
#the average of the numbers in the list 

import random

	sum = 0

	my_list = []
	
	for i in range(size):
		my_list.append(random.randint(1, 100))

	print("generated list is: ")
	print(my_list)

	if(len(my_list)>0):
